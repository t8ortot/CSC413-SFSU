# How to Play:
You have three lives. You lose lives when all of the stars have left the bottom of the window. When you lose all of your lives, you lose the game. Your objective is to break all of the bricks on the screen. Once you break all the bricks in the first level, you move on to the second level. Once you finish the second level, you win! There are different colored bricks that are in tiers. The colored tiers are in this order (from low to high): Purple, Yellow, Red, Green, Cyan, Blue, and White. When you hit a block of a higher tier, it drops to the lower tier. Purple blocks disappear. There are also splitter blocks that multiply the star and life blocks that grant you more lives.

Controls:
- LEFT ARROW: Move Left
- RIGHT ARROW: Move Right
- SPACEBAR: Fire
